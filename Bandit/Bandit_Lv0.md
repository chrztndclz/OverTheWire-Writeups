## Analysis

This level is simply about establishing your first connection to the Bandit server. The challenge introduces how to use SSH, how to specify a username, and how to connect using a non-default port. No file inspection or problem-solving is involved yet—your task is only to log in successfully using the provided credentials:

- Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
- Port: 2220
- Username: bandit0
- Password: bandit0

This level ensures you understand the basic structure of an SSH command and prepares you for navigating the remote environment in the upcoming levels.

## Methodology 

Step 1: Use SSH to connect to the server
Run the SSH command with the required port (-p 2220) and username:

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


Step 2: Enter the password
When prompted, enter the password:

bandit0


Step 3: Verify successful login
Once logged in, you should see a welcome message from OverTheWire and gain access to the Bandit0 shell environment. At this point, you have completed Level 0 and can move on to the Level 1 instructions.

## Reflection 

This level reinforced the basics of connecting to a remote machine using SSH. Although simple, it introduces important concepts like specifying a username and connecting through a non-standard port. Understanding this early step is crucial since every subsequent Bandit level depends on accessing the next account through SSH. This initial login also builds confidence in navigating terminal-based authentication, which is a fundamental skill in cybersecurity and Linux environments.
