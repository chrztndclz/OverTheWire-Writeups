## Analysis 
This level is about reading a file named **`-`** in the home directory. The challenge comes from the filename itself, because a dash is normally treated as an option by commands. So instead of just using `cat -`, we need to reference the file in a way that tells the system it’s a regular file. Once we do that, we can read the password and use it to log in to the next level.


----

## Methodology 

Step 1: List files in the home directory
Check what files are available:

ls

Step 2: Read the file safely
Since `-` is interpreted as an option/flag in many commands, we cannot run `cat command` on its own

This would cause `cat` to wait for user input instead of reading the file.

instead we use `./` this prevents the dash from being misinterpreted.

This forces the program to see the dash as a normal filename and allows the file to be read correctly.


Step 3: Copy the password and log in to the next level

Use SSH again, replacing the username with the next level:

ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When asked, paste the password you found.

## Reflection 

This level highlights an important lesson in Linux: **not all filenames are simple**. Some files may contain special characters that require careful handling. Learning how to reference files like `-`, `*`, or filenames beginning with spaces is essential for real-world terminal navigation and cybersecurity tasks. Understanding why `./-` works strengthens your awareness of how the shell interprets commands and arguments—a skill that becomes increasingly important in later Bandit levels and other wargames.
