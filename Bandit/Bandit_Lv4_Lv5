## Analysis

## Methodology 

Step 1: List files in the home directory
Check what files are available:

ls

Step 2: Move to inhere directory 

cd inhere

Step 3: Use cat command to all of the files until you find the human readable one 
Use `cat` to display its contents.  
The `./` helps avoid confusion with unusual filenames.





Step 5: Copy the password and log in to the next level

Use SSH again, replacing the username with the next level:

ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When asked, paste the password you found.
