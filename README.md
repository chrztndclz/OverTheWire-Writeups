# OverTheWire Writeups

Welcome to my [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) wargame writeups, created and maintained by [chrztndclz](https://github.com/chrztndclz). 
These writeups document my learning journey through various OTW wargames, offering clear explanations of each level’s logic and the techniques used to solve them.

This repository will steadily grow to include detailed, level-by-level breakdowns across multiple OverTheWire games — all sensitive passwords and keys are redacted to encourage fair, reproducible learning.

# No Spoilers Policy

Each writeup includes structured explanations of the analysis, methodology, tools used, and reflections on what was learned.
However, to preserve the integrity of OverTheWire’s hands-on learning design, passwords and level keys are always redacted.

Passwords appear in formats such as:

xxxx******yyyy

This ensures that learners still practice solving each level themselves.

# Repository Purpose
